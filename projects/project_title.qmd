## 1 Project Overview

Aneuploidy, or the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, is frequently observed in developmental disorders and cancer. Trisomy 12 (T12), a common chromosomal gain in cultured human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), has been associated with enhanced proliferation and stemness. iPSCs offer a powerful model to investigate such genomic alterations due to their capacity for self-renewal and differentiation.

In this project, we analyze transcriptomic changes associated with T12 in iPSCs to understand how gene dosage impacts cellular behavior. These insights are critical for ensuring genomic integrity in iPSC-based applications, particularly in regenerative medicine and disease modeling.

## 2 Load Required Libraries

```{r}
# Load tidyverse for wrangling, plotting, and file reading
library(tidyverse)

# Load tidymodels for modeling
library(tidymodels)

# Explicitly load recipes to ensure step_pca() is found
library(recipes)

```

## 3 Glimpse at the RNA-seq Data

I have loaded the CSV file using read_csv() and use head() and glimpse() to confirm successful import and examine the structure of the dataset.

The dataset BulkRNAseq_with_Chr.csv contains normalized gene expression values, log‚ÇÇ fold changes, adjusted p-values, and chromosome annotations for over 12,000 genes from disomic and trisomic iPSCs.

```{r}
# Read CSV and preview first few rows
library(readr)

rna <- read_csv("../data/BulkRNAseq_with_Chr.csv")
head(rna)

glimpse(rna)

```

## 4 Summarize & Interpret Dataset

## üîç 4.1 How many genes are upregulated or downregulated in trisomic iPSCs?

We define significantly upregulated genes as those with log‚ÇÇ fold change ‚â• log‚ÇÇ(1.5) and FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05. Downregulated genes meet the same p-value threshold and log‚ÇÇ fold change ‚â§ -log‚ÇÇ(1.5),comparing trisomic (P33_1, P33_2, P33_3) versus disomic (P3_1, P3_2, P3_3) iPSCs.

```{r}

# Step 1: Define thresholds
log2fc_cutoff <- log2(1.5)
padj_cutoff <- 0.05

# Step 2: Categorize genes
rna <- rna %>%
  mutate(
    Regulation = case_when(
      log2FoldChange >= log2fc_cutoff & pAdj < padj_cutoff ~ "Upregulated",
      log2FoldChange <= -log2fc_cutoff & pAdj < padj_cutoff ~ "Downregulated",
      TRUE ~ "Not Significant"
    )
  )

# Step 3: Filter out NA chromosome names and define correct chromosome order
valid_chromosomes <- c(as.character(1:22), "X", "Y")

# Step 4: Summarize data per chromosome and regulation category
reg_summary <- rna %>%
  filter(Regulation != "Not Significant", chromosome_name %in% valid_chromosomes) %>%
  mutate(chromosome_name = factor(chromosome_name, levels = valid_chromosomes)) %>%
  count(chromosome_name, Regulation) %>%
  complete(chromosome_name, Regulation, fill = list(n = 0))

# Step 5: Plot
ggplot(reg_summary, aes(x = chromosome_name, y = n, fill = Regulation)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Up- and Downregulated Genes in Trisomic vs. Disomic iPSCs by Chromosome",
    x = "Chromosome",
    y = "Number of Genes"
  ) +

## 5 Is there a clear clustering of iPSCs by karyotype (trisomic vs. disomic) in the principal component space?
